## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
A technical officer specializing in autonomous research and development, with over 7 years of experience in various fields of Mechanical Engineering. Currently focusing heavily on studying Machine Learning and implementing various algorithms and techniques in Python.

## EDUCATION
Technion, Israel Institute of Technology						          Haifa
Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, “BRAKIM” Excellence Program:
Elite B.Sc./M.Sc. for IDF future technological leaders 
-	Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (with thesis)   			October 2010 - March 2013
	-	Published and presented thesis subject as part of OPT-I 2014 (international optimization convention)
-	Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering 		           			October 2007 – January 2011

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Python Programming Experience (Self-Taught)	             			          2016 – ...  
Solid background and proficiency with Python 3.x, focusing on machine learning.
-	Reinforcement Learning (RL):
	-	Theoretical analysis and implementation of various contemporary RL approaches including Tile Coding (CMAC), Actor-Critic and DQN algorithms.
	-	Implemented efficient genetic algorithm (GA) optimizers.
	-	Both GA and RL algorithms achieved human level performance (and beyond) in various environments. In the case of deep learning, policy/value approximation is obtained using my own neural network code.
	-	Coded the environments used for the various algorithms, syntax consistent with OpenAI gym environments.
-	Neural Networks:
	-	Analytical derivation and application of fully connected and convolutional neural networks from basic Python modules. 
	-	Proficient with Tensorflow/Keras.
-	Misc Machine Learning: 
	-	Implemented basic functional ML algorithms such as: Linear Regression, K Means, 	Mean Shift Clustering, K Nearest Neighbors, Mixed Gaussian EM, and Support Vector Machine.
-	Other Notable Python Applications:
	-	Signal Processing: Implemented efficient Fast Fourier Transform and inverse (FFT/IFFT) functions. Implemented the Welch algorithm for obtaining a Power Spectral Density (PSD), using basic mathematical modules only. 
	-	Audio Processing: Program recording audio signals and producing FFT representation and periodograms, in real time.
	-	Numerical Solvers: Implemented various approaches such as Runge-Kutta for differential equations solution.




### Marine Engineering Department, IDF Navy (Rank: Captain)             		  2012 - 2018
- Lead a team developing a Matlab based shock simulation and calculation tool tailored to the navy’s needs – formulating and programming the 6DOF physics numerical solver and a user-friendly GUI. Presented both the theory and application in the ICME conference, Technion, 2016.
- Lead development of a large structural additions to Israeli Missile Ships, supervising various strength analyses and deriving approximation for vibration loads using harmonic analyses and measuring tests.
- Derived vibration PSD envelopes using Matlab, for various installations on several Israeli Navy platforms. The process included multiple measurement experiments, and employment of contemporary methods and tools for post processing. In addition, organized and documented the process, and educated several junior engineers in the required calculations and tools.  
- Advanced and solidified the Navy’s knowledge in the field of implicit dynamic analytical and numerical calculations, implementing, among others, DDAM (dynamic design analysis method).  
- Formulated and performed complex non-linear buckling analyses, co-developed a new approach for the application of structural imperfection.
